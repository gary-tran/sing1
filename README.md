    - If you don‚Äôt already have a Spotify account, you can create one at [Spotify's sign up page](https://www.spotify.com/us/signup).

2. Follow these instructions to set up your app and get the credentials: [Spotify Developer Apps Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps).

These credentials are necessary for authenticating your app and interacting with the Spotify Web API.

## üöÄ Project Setup

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gary-tran/sing1.git
```

#### 2. Navigate into the Project Directory

```
cd sing1
```

### Python Virtual Environment Setup

#### 1. Make the `.sh` File Executable (if necessary)

If the script is not already executable, you will need to change its permissions. Use the following command to make it executable:

```
chmod +x myenv_setup.sh
```

#### 2. Run the `.sh` Script

You can run it using the following command:

```
./myenv_setup.sh
```

### Database Setup

#### 1. Configure Database

Set up your environment variables by adding your credentials to the `.env` file:

-   Copy and paste your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret from your Spotify Web API App.
-   Add your PostgreSQL username and password.

Your `.env` (located at `backend/.env`) file should look like this:

```
DB_USER="your_postgresql_username"
DB_PASSWORD="your_postgresql_password"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_client_secret"
```

Update the `application.properties` (located at `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`) file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```
spring.datasource.username=your_postgresql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_postgresql_password
```

Replace "your_postgresql_username" with your PostgreSQL username in the `database_setup.sh` file and run the following command to set up the database:

```
psql -U your_postgresql_username -d postgres -f backend/scripts/setup_database.sql
```

#### 2. Make the `.sh` File Executable (if necessary)

If the script is not already executable, you will need to change its permissions. Use the following command to make it executable:

```
chmod +x database_setup.sh
```

#### 3. Run the `.sh` Script

You can run it using the following command:

```
./database_setup.sh
```

If you want more options for updating and adding tracks to your database with additional customization, check out the `populate_database.py` (located at `backend/scripts/populate_database.py`) script.

### Back-end Setup

#### 1. Navigate to the `backend` Directory

```
cd backend
```

#### 2. Build the Back-end

Since the back-end uses Maven, you can build the back-end using the following command:

```
./mvnw clean install
```

#### 3. Run the Back-end

To run the Spring Boot application:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The back-end will run on http://localhost:8080 by default.

### Front-end Setup

#### 1. Navigate to the `frontend` Directory

```
cd frontend
```

#### 2. Install Front-end Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the Front-end

Start the React development server:

```
npm run dev
```

The front-end will run on http://localhost:5173 by default.
